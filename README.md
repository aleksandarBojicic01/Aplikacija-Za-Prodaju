# Aplikacija-Za-Prodaju
This is a JavaFX application that communicates with an SQLServer database using the JDBC API. The application is built to simulate an app that can be used by a store chain that sells printers and parts for printers.

It features 3 menus. The first menu is for the HR department that enables users of the app to view, add, alter and delete employees and their data. The second menu is for the sales department. This menu allows users to view orders, sales, current stock and it also allows them to make sales (if the item is in stock). The third menu is a financial menu. It has reports of financial activity (sales, costs and profit) in the last 30 days.

## Main Menu
The main menu consists of these three buttons that lead to the department specific menus.

## HR Menu
This is the HR menu. Employee records are displayed in the tableview on the right. An employee record is accessed by clicking. Once clicked, almost all expected operations can be performed on the record, such as deleting and altering employee data, adding new employee records and searching for employee records. Below are pictures of these operations being performed.

## Financial department menu
This is the financial department menu. It is very much bare-bones right now and it can definitely be improved a lot. Currently it only displays sales, costs and profit for the past 30 days.
